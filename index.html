            Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and everything in its oribit. I kickstarted my career as a JAVA developer but was always fascinated with web programming and all things UI. After my first stint as a Front End Developer, around 4 years ago, there's been no looking back. Bringing mock-ups to life using HTML, CSS and JavaScript is my cup of tea.
            <br/><br/>
             From a service-oriented organization to a product-based, I have been involved in building responsive and scalable websites, identifying innovative ideas and POCs as well as providing guidance to team members.
            <br/><br/>
            Although I am more analytical, proactive, innovative and adaptable than ever, I am still striving for challenging problem statements and a highly stimulating work environment. Always in the search for opportunities to make contributions that help make the world a better place.
